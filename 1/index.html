  <p>Mio Akiyama is one of the five main characters in <a href="">K-ON!</a>. <i>She is a passionate and technical
  left-handed musician and writer who serves as the bassist</i>, <u>second vocalist and main lyricist of the band Ho-kago Tea Time. She is a kind and
  warm girl, albeit very shy and sensitive</u>. <del>Despite</del> her timid streak she often finds herself as the voice of reason
  amongst her bandmates, who often rely on her sensibility when in trouble.</p>
